# MicroServices
A collection of services working together to create a microservice

Right now, there is some funky stuff going on with compiling the services, that I'm still working with.
So right now, I would recommend just starting them from your IDE of choice.
For these services to work, you need to have both the LoginService And the MicroServiceProxy running
at the same time. Then make the API calls to the MicroServiceProxy.
